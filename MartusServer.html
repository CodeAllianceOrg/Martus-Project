<p class=MsoNormal>A. Purpose of this Document</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This document is meant to be an introduction to the Martus
Server. The target audience of this document is a decision maker at an
organization that is thinking about hosting a Martus Server. The Backup Server
provides a service to users of the Martus Client software, who are generating
human rights bulletins.  Martus Client software users can connect over the
Internet to a Backup Server and save copies of their bulletins there.  The
Client software users also get to specify which information in the bulletins is
public and which information is kept private to the user.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You need not be a Martus Client user to host the Martus
Server. It is important, however, that you understand the many issues involved
in hosting the Martus Server: technical, political, and legal. This document
attempts to identify a number of these issues, and help an organization decide
if they want to host a Martus Server.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>B. Why host a Martus Server?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The most compelling reasons to host a Martus Server are:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.5in'><span

</span></span><span dir=LTR>Cooperating with other operators of </span>Martus
Backup Servers to provide mutual data protection</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Not all groups will share all of these reasons, or choose to
take advantage of all of the capabilities of the Martus Server.  The underlying
assumption of the Martus Project is that information is the most powerful tool
against human rights abuses, and that providing basic secure information technology
will increase the effectiveness of that information.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>C. Functionality of the Martus Server</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Martus client provides the functionality for securely
creating Human Rights bulletins on a single computer. This functionality can be
extended by the Martus Backup Server:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>A Backup Server allows the Martus
client user to make sure bulletins are stored someplace in addition than the
local computer, which makes it more likely that bulletins will survive if
something happens to that computer (or the user).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>By using a Backup Server, private
bulletins can be shared with the headquarters (or coordinator) in your
organization (or coalition). This will allow bulletin creation by a number of Martus
users, and instant sharing of those bulletins to authorized users.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>The Backup Server works with the Web-based
 Martus Search Engine. The Martus Search Engine gathers the portions of
bulletins marked “Public” from those Backup Servers who want to publicize this
information. The Martus Search Engine makes the public information available on
the World Wide Web for the press, funders, activists, concerned citizens and
émigrés.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>D. Existing Martus Servers</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Benetech recommends using a Martus Server in conjunction
with the Martus Client, but how is an end user to find a Martus Server to use?
There are currently a number of Martus Servers in the world that Martus users
could use. Benetech will help end user organizations find a Martus Server (<a
href="mailto:info@martus.org">info@martus.org</a>). If an end user organization
chooses to use an existing Backup Server, it is important that they trust the
competency of the organization hosting the server. While the hosting
organization will not be able to read private information in bulletins, the end
user organization will be relying on them to keep the Backup Server running and
to not lose the bulletins that are saved on the Backup Server.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>E. Logistics of hosting a Martus Server</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If an organization is thinking about hosting a Martus
Server, there are two things it will need to consider: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.5in'>1)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
dir=LTR>A place to host a server</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.5in'>2)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
dir=LTR>Server hardware</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>E.1) A Place to Host a Server</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To host a server, a physically secure space is needed. This
security should include a locking room in which to run the server, sufficient
electric power, and a reliable Internet connection. It is also important to
make sure the server isn’t tampered with. If someone can get physical access to
the computer, they can compromise it, and even leave it running so end users
don’t know it is being snooped. This doesn’t mean that the snooper will be able
to read the private data or modify the public data, but they will be able to
read the public data and/or discard bulletins without saving them.  Benetech
recommends securing the BIOS of the computer and having a locking case -- sealing
the case makes it obvious if someone has opened it. The Server can be located
at a headquarters location with a broadband Internet connection, or at a
trusted commercial Internet Service Provider who can deliver the physical
security. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>E.2) Server Hardware</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The requirements for a Martus Server are not very
high—basically a server that can run GNU/Linux and has ECC (error-correcting)
RAM. For detailed server requirements, see the Server Installation Document.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>F. Operating a Martus Server</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There are three separate roles to be filled in operating a Martus
Server:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.5in'>1.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
dir=LTR>Policy Administration.  The person filling this role decides who gets
to use the Server: needs to be someone from the human rights field.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.5in'>2.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
dir=LTR>Server Operator.  This role should be filled by someone who knows how
to connect a server to a reliable Internet connection.  It could be the IT
department of a larger NGO, or it often will be a local and reliable Internet
Service Provider (such as a server co-location provider).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.5in'>3.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
dir=LTR>System Administration.  This role requires a higher level of technical
sophistication, since it requires GNU/Linux experience.  This person will be
responsible for maintaining the security and integrity of the </span>Martus
Server.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>F.1) Tasks associated with Policy Administration</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When an organization hosts a Martus Server, it will be
responsible for certain tasks that fall under what Martus calls Policy
Administration. Someone at the hosting organization will control who has the
ability to upload bulletins to a server, block accounts that don’t conform to
the organization’s use policies, and decide whether it asks users to make the
private sections of their bulletins readable by you as a “headquarters” account.
The Policy Administrator can also decide to affiliate with other Martus servers
that are run by other organizations, for the purpose of “mirroring”, or
backing-up, each other’s bulletins.  The workload for the Policy Administrator
will be light in the majority of situations. The workload will increase with
the number of clients using the Martus Backup Server, and with the amount of
control you want to have over who uploads bulletins to the Backup Server. The
Policy Administrator does not need to be an Information Technology expert, but
should be comfortable with using computer applications.  See the Martus Server
Policy Administrator’s Guide for details.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>F.2) Technical Skills of Server Operators</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>An organization that hosts a server will need a Server
Operator. The Server Operator is responsible for assuring electrical power,
Internet connectivity, operational reliability, and physical security of the Martus
Server. This person should be a computer networking professional.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>F.3) Technical Skills of Server Administrators</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Server Administration may be done by staff within the same
organization that operates the server, or the organization may contract with
another group to provide server system administration.  Benetech, the original
developer of the Martus software, offers system administration services for
groups who want to operate a Martus Server but need access to GNU/Linux system
administration skills. For more info, contact Benetech at <a
href="mailto:serverinfo@martus.org">info@martus.org</a>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A server can be administered locally, with no outside
administration. An organization should only consider this if it already hosts Unix
or GNU/Linux servers and has staff that is trained to do so. To host and
administer a Martus server locally, an organization will need a place to host a
server, and a System Administrator. The System Administrator should be a
trained Unix or GNU/Linux professional, who will be responsible for keeping the
 Martus Server running smoothly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>G. Security</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A hosted server needs to be secure. Physical security of the
server location was discussed earlier, but there are security issues that are
tied to how administration of the server is done. If an organization is hosting
a server that is being administered remotely by Benetech, it won’t have to deal
with administration-related security issues.  Benetech uses sophisticated
security techniques for remote administration, and any organization that
considers using Benetech to administer their system is encouraged to review
Benetech’s remote administration security procedures.  If it is administering
its own server, it will have to decide by what method administration will
happen. Administration can be done from the console, or remotely from anywhere
on the Internet via a tool called SSH. The most secure way to access the server
is via the console—being in the same room as the server. This isn’t always
possible, so administration can be done securely from other locations as well.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If an organization plans on remotely administering a server,
it should realize that the computer used for remote administration is the most
likely point of attack for someone trying to compromise a Martus Server. The Martus
Server is very secure (it uses special security technologies), and the
communications between the server and the remote administration computer is
very secure; but most computers that might be used for remote administration
are not as secure.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The developers of Martus believe that a Unix or GNU/Linux
workstations can be made to be more secure than a Windows workstation, when
used for remotely administering a Martus Server connected to the Internet.
Therefore, using a Unix or GNU/Linux system for remote administration is
strongly recommended if remote administration is desired.  Also, the computer
used for administration will be much harder to attack if it is <b>only</b> used
to administer the Martus Server, and never used for email or web browsing or
other Internet activities that interact with unknown people or services. There
are many options for creating a secure system to use for remote administration.
See Appendix A for options.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>H. Legal Issues</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There are a number of legal issues around hosting a Martus
Server. This section should not be construed as legal advice. Organizations
considering hosting a Martus Server should consult a lawyer. The following
section is meant to identify some of the legal risks involved, and should not
be considered exhaustive.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>An organization hosting a Martus Server is likely hosting
data that powerful entities might like to see or destroy. By hosting a Martus
Server, an organization is potentially putting itself at risk for attack via
the Internet; this kind of attack could affect the entire network of the
hosting organization, not just the Martus Server. Also, the organization could
put itself at risk for someone physically breaking into its offices and computer
areas.  One of the goals of having different Backup Servers in different
countries mirror the data of their peers is to have sufficient numbers of
copies of a server’s bulletins to reduce the potential for damage caused by
failures of a specific server, and to reduce or eliminate the incentive to
interfere with any one server.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In some countries, the mere collection of human rights
violation data may put groups at risk.  In addition, some countries restrict
the use of the cryptography technology used inside Martus client and server
software to keep private data private. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As mentioned earlier, the Martus Backup Server works with
the Web-based Martus Search Engine—a system for publishing public sections of
bulletins. Material contained in bulletins may be considered libelous by
powerful entities. By hosting a Martus Backup Server and choosing to make
information public, either through the Martus Search Engine or directly, an
organization may put itself at risk of lawsuit, and financial loss.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Most human rights groups understand these risks already, but
if the Martus software succeeds in its goal of making groups more effective,
this may increase the likelihood of reactions against groups using the Martus
technology!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I. Trust Issues</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Trust involves relinquishing control to another party, based
on a belief that the other party has the appropriate skills and operates in an
ethical manner.  There are various measures that can be taken to evaluate the
trustworthiness of another party.  What follows is a discussion of some of the
measures that may increase one’s trust in the Martus software, and in Benetech,
the organization that created the Martus software.  It is important to keep in mind
that even the most skillful and well-intentioned organizations are still capable
of honest mistakes, and that no security-related software is completely
invulnerable when faced with a very determined, resourceful attacker.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The operation of the Martus system involves many different
kinds of trust.  It is also designed to take into account the lack of trust
that by necessity exists in a field that is always under pressure from powerful
entities.  Here are some of the trust issues involved in implementing the Martus
system:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.5in'>1.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
dir=LTR>Trust of the </span>Martus Client software.  The issue here is how to
be sure that the Martus Client software does what it says it does.  There are
two risks here: one is that the Martus software doesn’t do what it says it does
by design, and the other is that it doesn’t do what it says by accident (also
known as a software bug).  Benetech’s answer to this trust issue is to publish
the human-readable source code to the Martus on the web, so that any programmer
can look at the code and assess its honesty. If you know a Java programmer,
they can view the source code at <a
href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/martus">https://sourceforge.net/projects/martus</a>. 
By offering complete transparency for the software, we can address this trust
issue and receive suggestions for improvements to the software.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.5in'>2.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
dir=LTR>Trust of the </span>Martus Backup Server software.  Assuming that the Martus
Client software is honest, the Backup Server operator has limited scope for
violating trust.  Operators can only read information marked public, and they
can’t make undetected changes to either the public or private data.  The worst
thing they can do is delete rather than save bulletins or corrupt the saved
bulletins to make them unreadable, either of which can be easily detected.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.5in'>3.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
dir=LTR>Trust of people using headquarters accounts to read private field
office bulletin information.  The person running the </span>Martus Client
software at a field office can decide to import their headquarters’ key.  By
doing so, the headquarters will be able to read the field office’s private
data, requiring the field office to trust their headquarters with their private
data. One advantage of trusting a headquarters with private data is that the
private information can be recovered by the headquarters if the person creating
the bulletins forgets their passphrase or is prevented from accessing their
data.  Groups should choose people using headquarters accounts extremely
carefully. Benetech as a matter of policy does not accept the responsibility of
serving as a headquarters.  The computer running Martus as a headquarters
becomes a target for attackers wishing to gain access to all private bulletin
data collected by the headquarters from all their field offices. People
operating Martus headquarters computers should take extra security precautions
to reduce the likelihood of unauthorized access to the private field office
data. In particular, the keys stored on the headquarters computer may be used
to open all private bulletin information from all of their field offices, so
the security of the computer holding the keyfile is particularly important. 
This keyfile is encrypted using the headquarters’ passphrase, but it is
possible for their secret passphrase to be unknowingly discovered.  Refer to
the Martus User Guide and Appendix A of this document for suggestions on

<p class=MsoNormal>J. Conclusion</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>End users can see significant benefit from using the Martus
Client in conjunction with a Martus Backup Server: backup of bulletins, sharing
bulletins within an organization, future publishing of bulletins via the Martus
Search Engine. Most organizations will use an existing Martus server, of which
there are a number to choose from. Organizations can talk to Benetech (using
the email address <a href="mailto:info@martus.org">info@martus.org</a>) about
picking a Martus Server.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It is possible to host a Martus Server. Hosting a server is
a possibly expensive and potentially risky undertaking that should not be
undertaken lightly. Organizations should only follow this path if they fully
understand the risks and benefits of hosting a Martus Server.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Benetech is committed to helping groups considering hosting
a Martus Server to assess the benefits and risks.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Appendix A: Secure Administrator’s Workstation</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A Unix or GNU/Linux system can be secured so that remote
administration from it to a Martus Server does not compromise the Martus
Server. This appendix is written for a technical person who has the technical
skills to be an administrator.  Key security items to implement are:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Single purpose</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If you only interact with known services, it will be harder
to attack your administrative workstation.  Thus it’s best to have a
workstation that’s dedicated to remote administration of the Martus Server.
Don’t use it to read email or browse the web.  Don’t run general office
software.  Don’t provide any remotely-accessible services.  Only access the Martus
Server, and the few websites needed to download software for your
administrative workstation and the Martus Server.  Don’t use DNS (put the names
and IP Addresses of the few needed servers into /etc/hosts).  Enforce these
policies with a firewall (see next item).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A firewall</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A very restrictive iptables (or equivalent) firewall on your
workstation will make sure that access to your workstation only occurs in the
manner you have approved.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Hardening</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It’s best to install and lockdown the administrative
workstation in the same manner used to install the Martus Server (see the
Server Installation Document), to turn off unneeded services and to generally
tighten security.  At the very least, you should run a generic hardening
utility like Bastille Linux (<a href="http://bastille-linux.org/">http://bastille-linux.org</a>),
and generally choose the most secure options.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Tripwire</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Tripwire will notify you when things change on your
administrative workstation. This is key to knowing if an attacker has
compromised your administrative workstation.  You can use the Martus Server
tripwire policy file as a starting point.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Passwords</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>See the Martus Server Policy Administrator’s Guide for
details on creating secure passwords.  Never run as ‘root’ on your
administrative workstation, except when installing software or making
administrative changes.  Use long passwords for all accounts.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Physical access</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Make sure that people who come in contact with your
workstation can’t abuse it to access the Martus Server.  Setup a screensaver
(like xscreensaver) to lock your workstation after a few minutes of inactivity,
so nobody can use your workstation when you step away from it.  Only write down
passwords on pieces of paper that are kept securely locked when they’re not in
your hand.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Secure access to Server</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When you remotely administer a Martus Server, you can
authenticate in two ways: password, or SSH Key pair. An SSH Key pair is
impossible to guess, so it is a more secure mode of authentication. However, if
your workstation is compromised, your SSH Key pair can be stolen (and its
