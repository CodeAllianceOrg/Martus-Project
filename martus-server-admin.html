<h2><a name="hostadmin">Host operating system administration</a></h2>
<p>This section discusses the administration of the host operating system, <b>dom0</b>.  This includes updating software, general systems administration tasks, as well as <b>Xen</b> virtual machine management. This only extends as far as starting and stopping virtual machines, and administering the operating system.
</p>

<h3><a name="upgradingmartus">Upgrading the Martus Server software</a></h3>
<p>The Martus Server software is upgraded in a manner similar to the
installation process: you copy files to <b>/var/tmp/martus-server</b> on the
dom0/host of the Martus Server, then run special commands to install these
files.
</p>
<p>To upgrade to a new Martus tarball, copy
<b>martus-server-VERSION.tar.gz</b> and
<b>martus-server-VERSION.tar.gz.sha1</b> to the server; to upgrade Sun java
and/or its libraries, copy <b>jre-6u*-linux-x64.bin</b>, <b>jaf-1_*.zip</b>
and <b>javamail-1_*.zip</b> to the server (see martus-server-install.html).
You can copy these files to the server with scp or rsync, or transfer them
with a USB flash drive.  To install the copied files, run
<b>install-dom0</b> (<b>only</b> if you're installing a new tarball) then
<b>install-martus</b> in <b>/var/tmp/martus-server</b>.  (If you installed a
new tarball, be <b>sure</b> you can still use ssh to login to the dom0/host.)
See <b>/usr/local/martus/doc/Readme.txt</b> for the full details about the
upgrade process, including the specific files and their versions.
</p>
<p>This upgrade process will install all the files for the host OS and the
guest OS.  Because the running Xen guest uses Logical Volume Management (LVM)
snapshots for filesystems, it must be rebooted to take advantage of the
changes.
</p>

<h3><a name="dom0updates">Updating the dom0 operating system</a></h3>
<p>CentOS uses the <b>yum</b> package management system to download and
install updates; yum was configured during the installation process.  For the
martus-server-4.0 release, the <b>install-martus</b> command will upgrade the host
and guest from CentOS-5.0 to CentOS-5.1, so you won't need to do the following
step...
</p>

<pre>
# check for updates
yum check-update

# if there are no updates, you're done; otherwise, apply the updates ...

# if you're using tripwire, run:
# mount-domU -r _shared
# /bin/nice -3 /usr/sbin/tripwire --check -I

# _if_ there's a new release of CentOS-5 (e.g. the previous command
#    showed a lot of updates), you need to prepare for the full update
yum -y clean all

# install the updates
# it's OK if you see: /sbin/restorecon reset ...
yum -y update
# if you get:
#   Transaction Check Error:
#     file /etc/logrotate.d/syslog from install of sysklogd-1.4.1-46.el5.x86_64#       conflicts with file from package syslog-ng-1.6.12-1.i386
# you'll need to do:
cd /var/cache/yum/base/packages
rpm --replacefiles --upgrade --nodeps -v -h sysklogd-[1-9].*
cd
yum -y update

# a package install could have removed some of our security hardening
# errors that you can ignore:
#  Shutting down Avahi daemon: Failed to kill daemon: No such file or directory
#  Stopping iSCSI daemon: iscsiadm: can not connect to iSCSI daemon (111)!
#  Stopping libvirtd daemon: [FAILED]
#  Running guests on default URI: running on Xen hypervisor, use xendomains to handle its guests
lockdown

# make sure iptables calls firewall (if it doesn't, see iptables.rpmsave)
tail -n 4 /etc/init.d/iptables

#
# if there's a new release of CentOS-5, it's safest to reboot now,
#    then come back to this point; in particular, if you don't reboot now,
#    the domU/guest update to CentOS-5.5 will yield hundreds of messages like:
#      VG4fast-CR_shared.snapshot: event registration failed: 11869:5 libdevmapper-event-lvm2snapshot.so dlopen failed: /usr/lib64/liblvm2cmd.so.2.02: undefined symbol: dm_udev_set_sync_support
#      VG4fast/snapshot117: snapshot segment monitoring function failed.
#      VG4fast-test: event registration failed: 11869:9 libdevmapper-event-lvm2snapshot.so dlopen failed: /usr/lib64/liblvm2cmd.so.2.02: undefined symbol: dm_udev_set_sync_support
#      VG4fast/snapshot121: snapshot segment monitoring function failed.
#      Logical volume "test" created
#

#
# if you need to update domU/guest, now's the time to do it (see later section)
#

# if you're using tripwire, update the database now, after running
mount-domU -r _shared

# if a new kernel was installed, you will need to reboot the system ...
# ... BUT, first update the domU operating system, see below
shutdown -r now
# if you're using tripwire, do one more update _after_ you reboot
#   the server then restart the Martus service on the Martus guest
#     (note that the Device Number values can change in the guest files);
#   and _after_ you create rpm's __db.* database, by running these 2 commands:
yum check-update
yum-domU check-update
# and after mounting the guest OS files (because they're tripwired):
mount-domU -r _shared
</pre>

After upgrading the dom0/host operating system, you'll want to
<a href="#domUupdates">update the domU/guest operating system</a>.

<h3><a name="xm">Managing Xen virtual machines</a></h3>
<p>The standard tool for interacting with the Xen hypervisor is <b>xm</b>. This tool will allow you to do common virtual machine tasks like starting and stopping a guest operating system, or see what machines are running.
</p>

<pre>
# check out xm usage
xm

Usage: xm &lt;subcommand&gt; [args]

Control, list, and manipulate Xen guest instances.

Common 'xm' commands:

 console              Attach to &lt;Domain&gt;'s console.
 create               Create a domain based on &lt;ConfigFile&gt;.
 destroy              Terminate a domain immediately.

 vcpu-set             Set the number of active VCPUs for allowed for
                      the domain.

&lt;Domain&gt; can either be the Domain Name or Id.
For more help on 'xm' see the xm(1) man page.
For more help on 'xm create' see the xmdomain.cfg(5)  man page.

For a complete list of subcommands run 'xm help'.

# show what virtual machines are running

<p>It is important to note that you can refer to a running instance of a virtual machine by the the Dom ID. The dom0 will always have the Dom ID 0.  The Dom ID of a guest is incremented every time a guest is started. Because of this, you can only refer to the numeric Dom ID while the guest is running. You can always refer to the guest by its <b>&quot;name&quot;</b> value, which corresponds to the &quot;name&quot; field in Xen virtual machine configuration file <b>/etc/xen/guestname</b>. Using the above output of <b>&quot;xm list&quot;</b>, we can run a few commands.
</p>

<pre>
# shutting down a running guest
xm shutdown 16

# starting up a guest
xm create  martus
xm console martus	# watch the boot, then type the martus passphrase

# shutting down a guest by name
xm shutdown martus

<h3><a name="users">Managing system users</a></h3>

<p>Martus Server administrators should <b>not</b> use the standard <b>useradd</b> command to add system users.

</p>

<h3><a name="firewall">Managing the custom firewall</a></h3>
<p>The Martus Server 3.0 utilizes a custom stateful packet inspection (SPI) firewall, built on top of the Linux Kernel's iptables.  Modification of this firewall is in violation of the Martus Compliance Statement.  There are variables in this firewall that can be changed to allow sysadmin access to the server. Specifically, the <b>/etc/martus/firewall.sh</b> firewall configuration file has quite a few features that can be enabled:
</p>

<pre>
cat /etc/martus/firewall.sh

#
# IP addresses used by /etc/init.d/firewall to manage non-Martus dynamic chains
# After change this file, run 'service firewall start'
#

# IP addresses of sysadmins/poladmins who connect to port 922 with SSH protocol
# instead of IP addresses, you can use host names from /etc/hosts
# add 'benetech1' and 'benetech2' if you want Benetech to be able to login
ssh_IPs="localhost domU dom0"		# recommended _minimum_ for domU/guest
ssh_IPs="localhost"			# recommended _minimum_ for dom0/host

# if the system administrators will login from another subnet, set
# this to the interface on that subnet (e.g. 'eth1')
management_interface=
#
# list the IP addresses of the workstations on the management subnet
management_ssh_IPs=

# servers that talk the TCP syslog-ng protocol, listening on the syslog port

<h2><a name="guestadmin">Guest operating system administration</a></h2>

<h3><a name="domUupdates">Updating the domU operating system</a></h3>
<p>The Martus Server uses LVM to provide the guest operating system with a snapshot of the real filesystems. This allows the administrator to update the guest OS filesystems without affecting the actual operation of the guest. Once the updates have been applied, the guest can simply be rebooted, which generates new filesystem snapshots. <b>yum-domU</b> was written to help manage applying updates to guest operating system filesystems.
</p>

<pre>
# check usage

        -u: Unmount the guest filing systems after run 'yum'
        -g guest: chroot into /guests/<guest> instead of /guests/_shared

        -d: Debug shell script (don't run commands, just show them)

<h3><a name="theory">Theory</a></h3>

<h4><a name="filesystemtypes">Read-only and Read-write filesystems</a></h4>

<p>When a Martus Xen guest (domU) is started, the Xen hypervisor gives it access to two sets of filesystems:
</p>

<pre>
read-only : / /usr /chroot (filesystems that hold software and OS config)
read-write: everything else (/var for linux; /home; /chroot/* for Martus)
</pre>

<p>[Passing some filesystems read-only makes it &quot;impossible&quot; for a successful compromise of the guest to &quot;allow&quot; the installation of an OS &quot;rootkit&quot;.]</p>
<p>The following shows all of the read-only filesystems:</p>
<pre>

</pre>
<p>The read-only filesystems can <b>only</b> be modified on the dom0/host. [You can use 'yum-domU' &amp; 'rpm-domU' to update software; else, just 'chroot'.] The guest will need to be rebooted before it will notice any changes.
</p>
<p>The read-write filesystems can <b>only</b> be mounted read-write on the dom0/host <b>if</b> the guest is not running (else filesystem corruption would result).
</p>
<p>Because of the above, we say that the dom0/host &quot;owns&quot; the read-only filesystems; and the dom0/guest &quot;owns&quot; the read-write filesystems.
</p>

<h4><a name="lvmsnapshots">Logical Volume Management snapshots</a></h4>

<p>We make it possible for the dom0/host to manage/upgrade the guests's read-only filesystems <b>while</b> the guest is running, using LVM snapshots.
</p>
<p>The guest's / /usr /chroot are /dev/VG*/*_shared.snapshot
</p>
<p>At guest start-time, /dev/VG*/var.snapshot is created, so the host can run 'yum' and 'rpm'.
</p>
<p>NOTE: /var/lib/rpm/ and /var/cache/yum/ are stored in /var.RO/ rather then /var/, because their contents are static (and authoritative) <b>except</b> when software is being updated (which only happens on dom0).
</p>

<h3><a name="practice">Practice</a></h3>
<p>To work with domU/guest filesystems from the dom0/host, the Martus Server includes a pair of scripts that mount all of a guest's filesystems &quot;as a single collection&quot;:</p>
<pre>
   mount-domU (alias is  'mdu'): the equivalent of Linux  'mount'
  umount-domU (alias is 'umdu'): the equivalent of Linux 'umount'
</pre>
<p>where the aliases were appended to /etc/bashrc using /etc/bashrc.martus</p>

<h4><a name="examples">Examples</a></h4>

<p>NOTE: if you do first do <b>export TRACE_mount_guest_FSs=t</b> you can watch the function calls to libLVM.sh that &quot;do the actual work&quot;.</p>
<p>Here's the basic operations:</p>
<pre>
   mount-domU martus	# mount the filesystems for guest 'martus' that dom0 &quot;owns&quot;
   mount-domU    m	# ... you can specify the guest by its abbreviation

</pre>
<p>Similar to the 'mount' command, an 'mount-domU' with no guest-argument will show you all the guest filesystems that are currently mounted on dom0:</p>
<pre>
   # mount everything, for the following &quot;show&quot;
   mount-domU -r _	# mount OS-software+config filesystems on /guests/_shared
   mount-domU -r m	# also mount them on /guests/martus

   mount-domU -0	# show /guests/_shared mounts   (OS-software+config mounts)
   mount-domU -g	# show  guest-specific mounts   (/guests/* except _shared)
   mount-domU -a	# show all guest-related mounts (all /guests/*)

  umount-domU -a	# remove the mounts we were demonstrating

NOTE: the most convenient debugging tool is 'mount-domU -a'.
</pre>
<p>You can mount the same guest (or _shared) filesystems as many times as you want, mount-domU is smart enough to notice they're already mounted.</p>
<pre>
   mount-domU    _	# mount OS-software+config filesystems (read-write by default)
   touch /guests/_shared/usr/lost+found/deleteme # succeeds
   fgrep /guests/_shared/usr /proc/mounts # ..because field 4 is rw,*
   mount-domU -w _	# ... same as above, since -w is the default
   touch /guests/_shared/usr/lost+found/deleteme # succeeds
   mount-domU -r _	# (re-)mount OS-software+config filesystems read-only
   touch /guests/_shared/lost+found/deleteme # fails
   fgrep /guests/_shared/usr /proc/mounts # ..because field 4 is ro,*

  umount-domU -a	# prepare for next example
</pre>
<p>You can mount multiple guest's filesystems at once:</p>
<pre>
   mount-domU    all	# (re-)mount all guests; errors if more then one, unless ...
   mount-domU -r all	# this will always succeed
   mount-domU -a	# show what you just mounted
  umount-domU    all	# umount the ones you just mounted
</pre>
[Using 'all' for guest-name is convenient even if you've only built one guest, because you don't need to remember what the guest is named on this server.]
<p>==&gt; Usage message for mount-domU and umount-domU as of 2007-08-18 &lt;==</p>
<pre>
Usage: mount-domU [-0|-g] [-a] [-u] [-r|-w] [-q]  [-d] [-t [-t]] guest
   mount the guest filing systems.

   The default is to _only_ mount the filesystems owned by dom0/host,
     which include OS-software+config filesystems (/ /usr /chroot) and the
     /var snapshot that's used to run 'yum' and 'rpm' from the dom0/host.
   Use the -g option to also mount the filesystems owned by domU/guest,
     such as /chroot/etc (to edit Martus service configuration files), and the
     guest's working /var.  Since the guest owns these filesystems, you must
     stop the guest before you mount (or filesystem corruption could occur).
   There's some 'special features':
     if specify -g | -s | -a, but no guest, just run 'df -m' on the filesystems
     if guest is 'all', mount all known guests (need -r if multiple guests)

   Here's the options:
        -0: mount guest filesystems owned by dom0/host  (the default)
        -g: mount guest filesystems owned by domU/guest (must stop guest)
        -a: show all mounted guest filesystems

        -u: umount instead of mount (it's best to use umount-domU instead)
        -r: mount read-only
        -w: mount read-write

        -d: Debug shell script (don't run commands, just show them)
        -t: Trace _calls_ to mount_guest_FSs; -t -t will trace the _function_

<pre>
This documents the steps one has to do for setting up the Martus service for
the first time after the guest is created (create-domU) and martus tarball is
installed (<b>install-martus</b>).

 a) log in as 'root' to the host domain (dom0)

 b) check if the guest is running

      xm list

 c) If it is running, shut it down

      xm shutdown martus -w

 d) Mount the shared filesystems

      mount-domU -g martus

 e) Create a martus config file

      cd /guests/martus/chroot/etc/MartusServer
      cp martus.sh.sample martus.sh

 f) Create the compliance document

      cd /guests/martus/chroot/etc/MartusServer.MSPA
      vi compliance.txt

 g)  Umount the shared filesystems

      cd /tmp
      umount-domU -g martus

 h) start the guest

      xm create -c martus

 i) Once the guest is running, from another terminal window log in as root
    to the guest.

 j) run the martus administration tool

      admin-martus

 k) create a keypair

      type 'k' 'c'

    when prompted, enter your passphrase. For more info see the MartusServer
    Policy Guide.  Next time you restart the guest, as part of the boot process
    you need to provide this passphrase when prompted.

    quit out of the keypair tasks by hitting 'q'

 l) create the magic word: it's best to use the MSPAClient GUI, otherwise
    see the end of item M.5 in the FAQ.

 m) restart the Martus server

      's' 'r

     when prompted, enter the passphrase.


At this point you now have a running Martus Server with a keypair and magic
word(s).
</pre>

<p>If you need to setup mirroring now, perform all the above steps on the other Martus Server.  Once both servers are up and running, follow the instructions below
</p>

<h3><a name="mirroring">Setting up mirroring between two servers</a></h3>

<h4><a name="mirroringtheory">The admin-martus command</a></h4>

<p>The admin-martus command sets up new mirroring arrangements, by storing remote-server's public keys in these two directories:</p>
<pre>
  /chroot/etc/MartusServer.MSPA/mirrorsWhoCallUs/
  /chroot/etc/MartusServer.MSPA/mirrorsWhoWeCall/
</pre>
<p>The file names contain the IP addresses, and start-martus parses these IP addresses and uses them to load the mirrorsWhoCallUs and mirrorsWhoWeCall firewall chains, whenever you start the Martus service.
</p>

<h4><a name="mirroringsetup">Using the admin-martus command</a></h4>

<p>1. Start the Martus service on both hosts (which we will refer to as HostA and HostB), and run 'admin-martus' on both hosts.</p>

<p>2. The admin-martus main prompt will appear (MAIN: (k)eypair magic(w)ords (a)ccount (m)irror (s)erver (o)ther (v)erbose:) Type 'k' followed by 's'. This will list the public code of the host.  Keep the public code of the 2 hosts handy.  You will need this to setup the mirroring. Go back to the main prompt by hitting 'q'.</p>

<p>3. From the main prompt on HostA, type 'm' followed by 'a'.  The subsequent dialog will ask for the public code and IP address of HostB.  Enter this information. You will be asked also for the passphrase used in creating the keypair for HostA.</p>

<p>4. This will fail and is expected. You will receive the following error:
<pre>
	Asking HostA for its Public Key...failed

      Bad public code, bad IP address, or mirror server is down
</pre>
<p>5. From the main prompt on HostB, type 'm' followed by 'a'.  The subsequent dialog will ask for the public code and IP address of HostA.  Enter this information, you will be asked also for the passphrase used in creating the keypair for HostB. This should succeed. Repeat Step 3 above to complete the mirroring between the 2 hosts.  The second attempt using step 3 should succeed.</p>

<p>6. Mirroring between the 2 hosts has now been set up.  From the main prompt, you can do 'w' and 'l' to list the mirroring information of the server.</p>

<p>7. At this time, you should restart both hosts.

<h2><a name="logging">Martus server logging strategy</a></h2>
<p>Martus Server 3.0 uses three different logging strategies.
First, <b>kernel logs</b> are gathered by <b>klogd</b> (from the standard
CentOS 5 syslogd rpm) and written to the
named-pipe <b>/tmp/root/klogd2syslog.fifo</b> which is read
by <b>syslog-ng</b>. Second, <b>syslog-ng</b> is used to write the all logs
to <b>/chroot/syslog/var/log/</b>.  Thirdly, <b>syslog-ng</b> is optionally
used to send all logs to a remote logging server.
</p>
<p>Two log daemons are used for security reasons.  Benetech's syslog-ng is configured to run in a chroot environment, with user privileges.  Each read from <b>/proc/kmsg</b> (with the 2.6 kernel) is checked for root permissions, so syslog-ng can't read it.  syslog-ng has the benefit of TCP based logging, instead of the UDP logging used by the standard syslogd; tunneling log traffic with tools like OpenSSH and Stunnel is not possible over UDP.
</p>

<h3><a name="klogd">Kernel logging with klogd</a></h3>
<p>A custom init script is provided to start <b>klogd</b>. This init script reads configuration information from <b>/etc/sysconfig/klog</b>.  klogd must run with root privileges to read from /proc/kmsg.
</p>

<h3><a name="syslogng">System logging with syslog-ng</a></LI></h3>
<p><b>Syslog-ng v1.6</b> is provided for local and remote logging of system messages.  Syslog-ng is run in a chroot, <b>/chroot/syslog</b>, and all logs are written to <b>/chroot/syslog/var/log/$YEAR/$MONTH/</b>.  Syslog-ng runs as user <b>syslogng</b>.

<h3><a name="remotelog">Remote logging with syslog-ng</a></LI></h3>
<p>Remote logging with syslog-ng is simple to enable, and highly recommended. It is important to read the <a href=#logcompliance>log server compliance</a> before enabling this feature.  Two methods of tunneling are supported, OpenSSH and stunnel, which is based on OpenSSL.  It is important to make sure that the IP address of the log server is added to <b>/etc/martus/firewall.sh</b>.  Turning on remote logging in syslog-ng is done by removing the comments in from of these two statements in <b>/etc/syslog-ng/syslog-ng.conf</b>:
</p>

<pre>
#destination d_stunnel { tcp( "localhost"; port("syslog") ); };
#log { source(inputs); destination(d_stunnel); };
</pre>

<p>This implies that your encrypted tunnel is listening on localhost, port <b>514</b> (the standard syslog port). <b>/etc/services</b> does not have <b>TCP</b> port <b>syslog</b> configured by default, but the Martus Server scripts append this port and the Martus ports.
</p>

<h4><a name="logssh">Remote logging over OpenSSH</a></h4>
<p>The SSH tunnel should be started in /etc/inittab. The line to add should look like this:
</p>
<tt>
EXAMPLE HERE
</tt>

<h4><a name="logstunnel">Remote logging over stunnel</a></h4>

<p>Configuration of <b>stunnel</b> requires a few bits of configuration. First, a syslog-ng log server must be in place, this document assumes you have a compliant one. Second, client/server certificates must be generated, and distributed to the Martus server. Thirdly, the stunnel configuration file must be modified with the details specific to your environment.
</p>
<p>It is beyond the scope of this document to describe the key generation process, but a client certificate with public and private keys, and a server certificate, with a only the public key must be created.  These should be placed in <b>/etc/stunnel/</b>. Make sure they are correctly referenced in <b>/etc/stunnel/stunnel.conf</b>.  Set permissions on the keys:
</p>
<tt>
chmod 400 /etc/stunnel/clientkey /etc/stunnel/serverkey
</tt>

<p>With keys in place, and log server information in hand, we can now configure <b>/etc/stunnel/stunnel.conf.  Note that we need to create a record for log-server in /etc/hosts</b>.
</p>

<pre>
cat /etc/stunnel/stunnel.conf

client=yes
chroot=/chroot/stunnel
pid=/var/stunnel.pid
cert=/etc/stunnel/syslog-ng-client.pem
CAfile=/etc/stunnel/syslog-ng-server-pub.pem
verify=3
debug=7
setuid=stunnel
output=/var/log/stunnel.log
# the stunnel process will listen on the accept port
# for connections, define log-server in /etc/hosts
[514]
 	accept=localhost:514
 	connect=log-server:514
</pre>

<p>We need to enable the stunnel process to start up on boot:
</p>

<pre>
# enable on dom0 boot
/etc/init.d/stunnel start; chkconfig --add stunnel
# restart syslog-ng
/etc/init.d/syslog-ng restart

# enable on domU
mount-domU _shared
cp -a /etc/stunnel/* /guests/_shared/etc/stunnel/
# with the stunnel parts uncommented
cp /etc/syslog-ng/syslog-ng.conf /guests/_shared/etc/syslog-ng/
chroot /guests/_shared/ chkconfig --add stunnel
xm reboot guestname
