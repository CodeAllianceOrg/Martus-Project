<h1>Martus&#8482; Server Policy Guide </h1>

<p class=HTMLBody>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p class=HTMLBody>Each Martus&#8482; Backup Server and/or Web-based Martus Search
Engine must have a Policy Administrator, who sets and enforces the policies
that determine how the server can be used. A Martus Server Policy Administrator
(MSPA) does not need technical skills or knowledge. However, to make
appropriate policy decisions, you need to understand the features of the Martus
Server. This guide describes the general features and policy decisions that
you, as the MSPA, control. In many cases, you will need to request that the
technical System Administrator actually make the policy changes for you, and
the System Administrator will report back to you.</p>

<p class=HTMLBody>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=HTMLBody>Also see the MartusServerCompliance document.</p>

<h2>Identifying a Server: IP Address, Keypairs, Public Keys, Public Codes, and
Passphrases</h2>

<p class=HTMLBody>Each Martus Server is accessed through an IP address, such as
10.121.205.11. The technical System Administrator will choose the IP address,
and provide that information to the MSPA. Each server also has a unique
&quot;Public Code,&quot; which is automatically created when the server is
initially configured. A Public Code comprises twenty digits, written as five
groups of four digits. For example, a Public Code might be
1234.5678.2345.6783.4567. Martus clients use a combination of the server&#8217;s IP
Address and Public Code to identify a specific server. If either of these
values changes, all the existing clients will have to be notified.</p>

<p class=HTMLBody>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=HTMLBody>The server&#8217;s Public Code is actually a short version of the
server&#8217;s Public Key. A Public Key is hundreds of characters long, so it is
rarely shown to users. During initial configuration, the server creates both a
Public Key and a Private Key. Together, the Public Key and Private Key are
referred to as the Keypair. </p>

<p class=HTMLBody>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=HTMLBody>The server&#8217;s Keypair is stored on disk protected by a passphrase
that you set during initial configuration, and can change at any time. A
passphrase is like a password, but should be longer and more difficult to
guess. Choose a passphrase that includes alphabetic, numeric, and punctuation
characters, and does not contain names or dates (because those can be easy to
guess). See the section below, titled &#8220;Choosing a Good Passphrase&#8221;. Change the
passphrase periodically, so that it is even more difficult for an attacker to
obtain the Keypair. Remember to create a new backup copy of the server Keypair
file each time you change the passphrase.</p>

<p class=HTMLBody>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=HTMLBody>The Private Key is never displayed or shared with anyone. It
is only used by the software to prove that this server is authentic. If the
server&#8217;s Private Key is lost or stolen, you should create a new Keypair. <span
style='color:black'>For details, see the section titled &#8220;Creating a New
Keypair&#8221;.</span></p>

<h2>Granting and Denying Upload Rights to Client Accounts </h2>

<p class=HTMLBody>Martus Servers keep track of which Martus clients are allowed
to upload bulletins. Once a particular client obtains upload rights, that
client will have full use of the server indefinitely, unless you choose to
&quot;block&quot; that client. As with servers, clients are associated with a
long Public Key and a shorter Public Code. Normally, you&#8217;ll identify client
accounts by their Public Codes.</p>

<p class=HTMLBody>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=HTMLBody>Rather than requiring you to grant upload rights individually
for client accounts, Martus Servers rely on &quot;Magic Words,&quot; which are
specific to a particular server. A Magic Word is a word or phrase that a new
client enters once in order to request upload rights on a server. Typically,
the organization that sets up a new Martus client provides the client with the
information they&#8217;ll need to begin uploading bulletins to a Martus Server: the
server&#8217;s IP address, Public Code, and a Magic Word. As you distribute Magic
Words to users, inform them if you plan to deactivate the Magic Word at a
certain date. </p>

<p class=HTMLBody>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=HTMLBody>Theoretically, a server could create a different Magic Word
for each client. However, in practice, server operators tend to use a single
Magic Word for each group of clients (for example, one Magic Word for each
project, training session or Headquarters). You can add and remove Magic Words,
and you can view a list of currently active Magic Words. </p>

<h2>Managing Accounts and Bulletins</h2>

<p class=HTMLBody>You can choose to block an account, perhaps because that
account is using the server for illegitimate purposes.  All the bulletins of
the blocked account will remain on the server, but they can&#8217;t be retrieved or
augmented unless the account is unblocked. At any time, you can view a list of
client accounts that have upload rights, or a list of accounts that have been
blocked. You can view the upload history for any client account, or view any
available contact information for a given account.  You can &#8220;delete&#8221; a
bulletin, which will make it impossible to retrieve (except that you can
undelete it, and the system administrator can access it); you should only do
this in accordance with the Server Compliance Statement in effect on this server
at the time.</p>

<h2>Creating a New Keypair</h2>

<p class=HTMLBody>When a Martus server is first configured, a Keypair is
created. You shouldn&#8217;t need to create a new Keypair later unless the original
Keypair is lost or damaged, or you believe someone has discovered the
passphrase. Creating a replacement Keypair is a major disruption, because all
the existing clients will have to re-configure their systems with the server&#8217;s
new Public Code before they will be able to connect to the server. Remember
that it is not safe to distribute Public Codes via email (because the email
could be modified in transit).</p>

<h2>Choosing a Good Passphrase</h2>

<p class=HTMLBody>The simplest method to easily create a good password is to
use one of the high-quality passwords that the Martus server software will
create for you when you setup the keypair. </p>

<p class=HTMLBody>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=HTMLBody>Alternatively, you can create a passphrase that includes
several digits and punctuation characters, and is at least twenty characters
long. Passphrases should never contain names of family members, friends, pets,
towns, cities, or countries. They should not contain made-up words from movies
or books. Do not use the first letter of each word of a sentence, unless the
sentence is unusual, and you thought up the sentence yourself, and you keep the
sentence secret.</p>

<p class=HTMLBody>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=HTMLBody>A passphrase should not contain any dates, phone numbers, or
street addresses. It should not contain any words that can be found in any
dictionary of any language (unless you use the diceware method mentioned
above). Do not use dictionary words with letters replaced by digits, like
&#8220;p01nt&#8221;. </p>

<p class=HTMLBody>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=HTMLBody>MSPA&#8217;s might only use the passphrase on a weekly or monthly
basis, so it will be difficult to remember it between uses. In an environment
that is physically secure, and where you protect the written copy very
carefully, it is safest to use a passphrase that is so complex that even you
can&#8217;t remember it without referring to a written copy. Even if you choose a
passphrase that you can remember, you should always keep a written copy safely
locked away in a very secure location, in case you forget it. </p>

<p class=HTMLBody>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=HTMLBody>Except when you are using the passphrase, don&#8217;t keep a
written copy of it on your person, anywhere near your desk, or near the server.
This applies even if the written copy is a &#8220;coded&#8221; version of the real
passphrase that reminds you of the real passphrase. Attackers can be
surprisingly clever. Also, remember that anyone who wants to steal your
passphrase has probably read this advice.</p>

<h2>Policy Administrator Tasks</h2>

<p class=HTMLBody>As a Martus Server Policy Administrator, you can perform
several tasks related to server policies. </p>

<p class=HTMLBody>These tasks are performed using the &#8216;martusadmin&#8217; command,
which you can run by logging in to the server with your special policy
administrator account. You&#8217;ll find the commands for these tasks in the Keypair,
Magic Words, and Client Account, Mirroring, Server and Other menus of the
&#8216;martusadmin&#8217; command. Each menu task is listed here, along with a brief
description of the task.</p>

<p class=HTMLBody>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=HTMLBody>The menus contain words whose first letter is in parentheses,
such as (a)ccount; to perform the action suggested by the word (or phrase), you
hit the letter in parentheses (&#8216;a&#8217; in this example), without hitting ENTER. 
You only need to hit ENTER when you&#8217;re prompted for information,</p>

<p class=HTMLBody>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=HTMLBody>When you first login, you will see the &#8220;MAIN&#8221; menu. If you
hit one of the action letters, you will enter a specialty task mode; to exit a
task mode, keep hitting ENTER (or hit &#8216;q&#8217; for quit).</p>

<p class=HTMLBody>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=HTMLBody>Note that all the policy administrative actions will be
logged. The technical System Administrator will be able to find out what tasks
were done, by who, and when. This is an important security feature, to help the
system administrator detect whether an unauthorized person is modifying the
server.</p>

<h3>Server Keypair Tasks</h3>

<p class=HTMLBody><b><span style='color:black'>Create New Keypair</span></b><span
style='color:black'>: Create a new Keypair during the initial set-up or if you
must replace the original Keypair because it has been compromised. (If you are
replacing a Keypair, you must delete the original first.) A new Keypair
requires a new passphrase, and a new Public Code is generated. Distribute the
Public Code securely to all account users; it&#8217;s OK for anyone to know it, but
you must make sure it&#8217;s not modified &#8220;in transit&#8221;.</span></p>

<p class=HTMLBody><span style='color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=HTMLBody><b><span style='color:black'>Delete Current Keypair</span></b><span
style='color:black'>: Use this command only if the current Keypair has been
compromised. Creating a new Keypair is very disruptive, as it requires all
account users to re-configure their systems.  Because this operation is so
dangerous, running this command will save a copy of the current Keypair but it
will <b>not</b> delete the current Keypair; only the system administrator can
delete the Keypair.</span></p>

<p class=HTMLBody><span style='color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=HTMLBody><b><span style='color:black'>Generate passphrases</span></b><span
style='color:black'>: Use this command to generate very high-quality
passphrases, suitable for the &#8216;root&#8217; password or other administrative
passwords.</span></p>

<p class=HTMLBody><span style='color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=HTMLBody><b><span style='color:black'>Change Keypair Passphrase</span></b><span
style='color:black'>: Change the Keypair passphrase periodically, to make it
more difficult for an attacker to gain access to the Martus server. To change
the passphrase, you&#8217;ll need to enter the current (old) passphrase and the new
passphrase. Be sure to back up the Keypair file after you change the
passphrase. </span></p>

<p class=HTMLBody><span style='color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=HTMLBody><b><span style='color:black'>Backup Keypair (and other
configuration data)</span></b><span style='color:black'>: Back up the server
configuration data after you create the original Keypair (or change its
passphrase), add or delete Magic words, alter Server mirroring, etc. The files
you back up are saved to a floppy disk; if you can&#8217;t insert a floppy disk
because the server is remote, you will need to do an rsync backup (see </span>the
MartusServerCompliance document).</p>

<p class=HTMLBody><span style='color:blue'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=HTMLBody><b>Show IP Address and Public Code</b>: Use this command to
display the server&#8217;s IP address and Public Code, which you&#8217;ll need to provide
to account users (along with a Magic Word).</p>

<h3>Magic Words T<span style=''>a</span>sks</h3>

<p class=HTMLBody><b>List Existing Magic Words</b>: See a list of all the Magic
Words currently in effect</p>

<p class=HTMLBody>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=HTMLBody><b>Add a New Magic Word</b>: Add a new Magic Word. </p>

<p class=HTMLBody><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p class=HTMLBody><b>Delete a Magic Word</b>: Remove a Magic Word. Existing
clients who have already connected to the server using this Magic Word will not
have to re-enter the new Magic Word unless they create a new account. </p>

<h3>Client Account Tasks</h3>

<p class=HTMLBody><b>List Folders</b>: Display the list of folders (i.e. directories)
for all accounts on the server.</p>

<p class=HTMLBody>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=HTMLBody><b>List Public Codes</b>: Search for a specific account&#8217;s
Public Code when you know a portion of the Public Code.  To see a list of
Public Codes for all accounts on the server, just hit ENTER when asked to
specify a search string.</p>

<p class=HTMLBody>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=HTMLBody><b>Search Contact Information</b>: Find all the accounts
whose public contact information contains a specific string; remember that this
information is optional.  If no string is specified (i.e. you just hit ENTER),
show the contact information for all accounts that have chosen to make their
information public.</p>

<p class=HTMLBody>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=HTMLBody><b>List Blocked Accounts</b>: Display the list of accounts
that have been blocked (or &#8220;banned&#8221;) from accessing the Martus server.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=HTMLBody><b><i>Note:</i></b> Before performing any of the following
tasks, you must enter the Public Code (or Public Key) for the client account
you want to work with. A client user can view their Public Code by choosing
Help &gt; View My Account Details in the Martus Client. Many server logs of
client activity also display the Public Code; but it's difficult to identify
users based on server log activity, so it is not a reliable way to determine
the Public Code for a user. It is also possible to locate an account by
searching any available contact information that the clients have chosen to
upload. We do not recommend using contact information to specify the account,
because the contact information may be incorrect, or multiple accounts may have
similar or even identical contact information.</p>

<p class=HTMLBody><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p class=HTMLBody><b>Show Contact Info</b>: Display the contact information for
the account, if the account user has chosen to upload any.</p>

<p class=HTMLBody>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=HTMLBody><b>Can Account Upload</b>: Determine whether an account has
submitted a valid Magic Word and thus acquired the right to upload bulletins.</p>

<p class=HTMLBody>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=HTMLBody><b>Show Upload History</b>: Display the history of uploaded
bulletins from the client account.</p>

<p class=HTMLBody>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=HTMLBody><b>Block/Unblock an Account</b>: Block (or &#8220;ban&#8221;) an account
from accessing the Martus server, or remove the block (&#8220;unban&#8221;) from an account
that was blocked earlier. A blocked account cannot upload or retrieve any
bulletins. When an account is un-blocked, it reverts to the same permissions
that it had before it was blocked.</p>

<p class=HTMLBody>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=HTMLBody><b>Delete/Undelete Bulletins</b>: A bulletin can be &#8220;deleted&#8221;
(or &#8220;hidden&#8221;), which makes it impossible to retrieve; you should only do this in
accordance with the Server Compliance Statement in effect on this server at the
time.  A deleted bulletin is not physically removed from the server; a system
administrator can retrieve it, and you can undelete it.  You can also list all
the bulletins that have been deleted for a specific account.</p>

<h3>Server Mirroring T<span style=''>a</span>sks</h3>

<p class=HTMLBody><b>List Existing Mirrored servers</b>: See a list of all the
servers we will periodically call (at least once an hour).  For each remote
server, we will make sure that we have a local copy of each of its bulletins
(that have <b>not</b> been deleted), by &#8220;pulling&#8221; each bulletin that&#8217;s not
stored locally.  [Note that the mirroring for a specific remote server will not
be successful unless they add your server for mirroring.]</p>

<p class=HTMLBody>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=HTMLBody><b>Add a New Mirror server</b>: To enable mirroring to a
server, you need to know the remote server&#8217;s Public Code and IP address (i.e.
the MSPA on the remote server needs to run the <b>Show IP Address and Public
Code</b> command described above).  You can optionally create a name for the
remote server&#8217;s IP address; this name does not need to be a domain name, and
only needs to be unique on your own server.  You will <b>not</b> be able to add
a remote server for mirroring unless the Martus service on the remote server is
running when you try to perform the &#8220;add&#8221;.</p>

<p class=HTMLBody>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=HTMLBody>Note: remember that the remote server will need to add your
server before any mirroring happens.  Once each server has added the other for
mirroring, each server will periodically call the other server (at least every
hour) to make sure that that the local server has a copy of every bulletin on
the remote server.</p>

<p class=HTMLBody><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p class=HTMLBody><b>Delete a Mirror server</b>: Stop calling the remote
server, and remove the authorization for the remote server to call your own
server.  Note that all bulletins that were mirrored before you delete a mirror
server will remain intact.</p>

<p class=HTMLBody>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=HTMLBody><b>List Old/Deleted Mirror servers</b>: List all the remote
servers that were once mirrored to this server (and thus represent bulletins
that may exist on both servers).</p>

<h3>Other Miscellaneous Tasks</h3>

<p class=HTMLBody><b>Backup configuration data</b>: This is the same as the <b><span
style='color:black'>Backup Keypair (and other configuration data)</span></b><span
style='color:black'> action in the Keypair Task.  It was copied to the
Miscellaneous menu because it&#8217;s used to backup data created in all the Tasks
(and also backup data that can be altered by the system administrator).</span></p>

<p class=HTMLBody>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=HTMLBody><b>Change MSPA Password</b>: this enables you to change the
password of the account you use to login to the server.  You can only perform
this task when the server is unlocked, so you will need the assistance of the
system administrator.</p>

<p class=HTMLBody><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p class=HTMLBody><b>Bulletin Integrity Check</b>: This lets you check every
bulletin on the system to make sure it has not been corrupted.  With a lot of
accounts on the server, this can take many tens of minutes to run.</p>

<p class=HTMLBody>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=HTMLBody>If you find a corrupted bulletin, it&#8217;s best to delete it, and
then have your system administrator remove it from
/chroot/etc/MartusServer/isHidden.txt an then restart the Martus service.  If
the bulletin was uploaded by one of your users, have the account holder move
the bulletin into their outbox (so that it will be re-sent to the server).  If
the bulletin was mirrored from another server, then the mirroring process will
restore it (if you delete the bulletin from isHidden.txt and restart the Martus
service).</p>

<p class=HTMLBody>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=HTMLBody><b>Software Release Information</b>: This lets you check the
version of all the critical software on the Martus server.</p>

<h3>Server Tasks</h3>

<p class=HTMLBody>These tasks are used by the system administrator to start and
stop the Martus service, called (b)egin and (e)nd, and lock/unlock the server
or check the server status.</p>

<p class=HTMLBody>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Possible Future Enhancements</h2>

<p class=HTMLBody>In the future, MSPA's are likely to have additional
responsibilities. Here are some of the features that may be added:</p>

<p class=HTMLBody>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=HTMLBody>- Upload limits. MSPA's might be able to set limits on the
number, size, or combined size of bulletins that each client can upload within
a specific time period.</p>

<p class=HTMLBody>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=HTMLBody>- Martus Search Engine. The MSPA would decide whether to send
(or &#8220;amplify&#8221;) public bulletins to any Martus Search Engines. Martus Search
Engines will allow the public to use Web-based searching and browsing features
to access public portions of bulletins.</p>

<p class=HTMLBody>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=HTMLBody>- Stricter control over client accounts. MSPA's may be able
to create Magic Words that would be valid for only a single account. Or they
might be able to manually grant upload rights to a specific client account
instead of relying on Magic Words.</p>
