1. Install Gradle (http://gradle.org) latest was 2.3

2. Update .bash_profile
	#Setting PATH for Gradle 2.3
	GRADLE_HOME=~/Dev/gradle-2.3;
	export GRADLE_HOME
	export PATH=$PATH:$GRADLE_HOME/bin
	
3. Install Android SDK API 17, 19, 20 and 21 (Or Android Studio) 
		Use SDK Manager in Android Studio to install this
		
4. Update .bash_profile
	#Setting up ANDROID_HOME for gradle builds
	export ANDROID_HOME=~/Library/Android/sdk

5. Install Build Tools revision 20.0.0, and 19.1
	Use SDK Manager in Android Studio to install this

6. Not sure why I needed to add the following to the VitalVoices gradle script
	in the section 
	android {
	I added    
		lintOptions {
       		 abortOnError false
    		}
    		
    	Lint was complaining from the command line about an Invalid package due to
    	reference in library; not included in Android: javax.swing.table. Referenced from org.martus.util.SortableTableModel.
    	But Android Studio seemed to ignore this.

7. From Terminal change to the correct build directory
	eg. cd ~/EclipseMartus/martus-android/secure-app-vital-voices
	
8. Start the Build
	eg. gradle build
